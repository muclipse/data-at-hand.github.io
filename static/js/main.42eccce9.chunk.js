Data visualization is a common way that mobile health apps enable people to explore their data on smartphones. However, due to smartphones\u2019 limitations such as small screen size and lack of precise pointing input, they provide limited support for visual data exploration with over-simplified time navigation, even though time is a primary dimension of self-tracking data. Data@Hand leverages the synergy of speech and touch; speech-based interaction takes little screen space and natural language is flexible to cover different ways of specifying dates and their ranges (e.g., \u201c",i.a.createElement("i",null,"October 7th"),"\u201d, \u201c",i.a.createElement("i",null,"Last Sunday"),"\u201d, \u201c",i.a.createElement("i",null,"This month"),"\u201d).

Furthermore, despite its huge potential benefits, mobile visualization research in the personal data context is sparse. This work aims to empower people to easily navigate and compare their personal health data on smartphones by enabling flexible time manipulation with speech. We designed and developed Data@Hand, a mobile app that leverages the synergy of two complementary modalities: speech and touch. Through an exploratory study with 13 long-term Fitbit users, we examined how multimodal interaction helps participants explore their own health data. Participants successfully adopted multimodal interaction (i.e., speech and touch) for convenient and fluid data exploration. Based on the quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss design implications and opportunities with multimodal interaction for better supporting visual data exploration on mobile devices.")),i.a.createElement(s,null),i.a.createElement(l,{title:"Supplementary Material",hashId:"supplementary"},i.a.createElement("table",{className:"supplementary-material"},i.a.createElement("tr",null,i.a.createElement("th",null,"A ",i.a.createElement("b",null,"presentation slide")," used in the tutorial stage"),i.a.createElement("td",null,i.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://data-at-hand.github.io/supplementary/tutorial-slide.pdf",target:"_blank"},"Download"))),i.a.createElement("tr",null,i.a.createElement("th",null,"A ",i.a.createElement("b",null,"video clip")," demonstrating the push-to-talk method for speech interactions, also used in the tutorial stage"),i.a.createElement("td",null,i.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://data-at-hand.github.io/supplementary/tutorial-speech-description.mp4",target:"_blank"},"Download"))))),i.a.createElement(f,null))}),E=a(16),b=a(5),w=function(){return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"main-content"},i.a.createElement("h1",null,"Privacy Policy"),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Data@Hand Team built the Data@Hand app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Data@Hand Team at no cost and is intended for use as is."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.
